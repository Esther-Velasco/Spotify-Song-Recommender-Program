# Spotify-Song-Recommender-Program

## Overview
This project is a song recommender program that harnesses the power of web scraping and Spotify's API to curate personalized music suggestions based on user preferences. Whether you're exploring new genres or seeking recommendations within your favorite style, this program has you covered.

## Features
Web Scraping: The program gathers data from Billboard Hot 100 (https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/) as the program first checks whether the userÂ´s input song belongs to the latest world hits.

Spotify API Integration: Leveraging the Spotify API, the recommender pulls in-depth information about tracks, artists, and genres, ensuring accurate and relevant suggestions. The programme will suggest a similar song as the one inputed to the user using the get.audio-features Spotify request.

User Preferences: Customize your recommendations by inputting your preferred genres, artists, or mood. The program tailors its suggestions to match your unique taste.
